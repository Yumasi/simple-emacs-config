* Introduction

This repository contains a simple Emacs config for =EPITA= students. It is made
to serve as a sane basis for building your own Emacs configuration.

* Installation

Delete your existing =.emacs.d= folder then execute the following command:

#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/Yumasi/simple-emacs-config.git .emacs.d && emacs
#+end_src

Emacs will send fetch and install the required packages. Once it is done, it may
require restarting emacs.

** Irony-server

In order to have autocompletion and on-the-fly syntax checking, build irony
server from Emacs with =M-x irony-install-server=.
